## Project Outline

Surfs Up! In todays analysis we are going to use to sqllite provided data in order to provide insights for better business decision.

We will be able to act quick on data. Using data analysis we are going to load data and provide a traoditional ETL (Extract, Transform & Load) process for the provided data. 

At the same time this is an analysis for an assigment related to Data Analytics Bootcamp. 

- Please review main SQL script for programming commands: 
[main Script](https://github.com/danielczz/HW_10-Analyzing_data_with_SQLLite_-_Python/blob/master/main.ipynb).


#### **1. Data gathering**
- Data we are currently using is: 

    * 1 sqllite DataBase 
    * 2 csv files
    
#### **2. Data cleaning**
- Data is most of it already clean. 
- Some exercises will be done to "fine-tune" some information in the Database. 

#### **3. Data analysis** 
- Using SQLAlchemy and Python commands we are generating most of the analysis.


## Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration

### Precipitation Analysis

### Station Analysis

### Temperature Analysis (Optional)


### Other Recommended Analysis (Optional)


## Step 2 - Climate App

Now that you have completed your initial analysis, design a Flask API based on the queries that you have just developed.

* Use FLASK to create your routes.

### Routes

* `/api/v1.0/precipitation`
* `/api/v1.0/stations`
* `/api/v1.0/tobs`
* `/api/v1.0/<start>` and `/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>`
